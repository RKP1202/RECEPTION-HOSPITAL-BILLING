The Privilege &amp; Appointments Project

- Billing system
    - The billing system will be able to bill items purchased by the members, and add or redeem points based on the user’s point score
    - The billing system will be able to take new registrations of the privilege card and will send the card virtually to the new members’ whatsapp.
    - The billing system can work as a normal billing system and can replace tally in the future
    - The billing system will implement barcode system for scanning members’ privilege card as well as the products
- Appointment system
    - The appointment system will be able to take appointments using Whatsapp bot/Webapp, and will be able to take payments and automatically reflect the details in the on-site displays
    - The appointment system will guide patients as to which procedure is pending and which room they have to go to in the hospital.
    - A tone should be played once the next patient’s time is there to go to the specific room.
    - A nurse should guide patients as to how to look at the appointment system monitors.
    - In future this should be accommodated with the fully fledged ERH system.
